## Other

- When click another marker, it should close the other one (use Redux([guide here](https://egghead.io/courses/fundamentals-of-redux-course-from-dan-abramov-bd5cc867))).
- More info links for the buildings - use the MoreInfoURL link option

## Buildings page

- order by name/architect/date built.
- Filter by Architect.
- Shuffle button.
- Search bar.
- filter to see ones you've visited / unvisited
- back to top floating button
- Instead of get directions, should say "View on map".

## Game page

- I wanted to build a game using the same data, to test user's on their knowledge of the buildings. E.g. Photo, what building is this, user inputs their answer.
- add more steps to game - atm just says correct or incorrect. Score counter etc.

## Improve Styling

- fix for mobile - iphone se not looking great.
- extract tailwind into scss docs.
- apply default colours consistently.
  -Consistent colors, search with % for white gray black neutral etc and replace. Use lighten thing if need to

## Get contributions

make more user friendly by:

Add inline comments to complex code sections: This will help new editors understand the logic and purpose of different parts of the codebase.

Set up a CI/CD pipeline: This will automatically run tests and checks on pull requests, making it easier for new editors to ensure their contributions meet the project's standards.

Provide a detailed project roadmap: This will give new editors an idea of the project's direction and where they can contribute most effectively.

Set up a development branch: This will allow contributors to work on features without affecting the main branch directly.
