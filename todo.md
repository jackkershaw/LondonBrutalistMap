## Priority

Redux - do this tutorial using sandbox to make sure understand it well. Tutorial [here](https://daveceddia.com/redux-tutorial/)

## map

- Improve loading speed of the map / use skeleton as it loads slow atm
- pre load image on hover

## Improve Styling

- use just tailwind (change in portfolio and cv)
- fix for mobile - iphone se not looking great.
- apply default colours consistently.
  -Consistent colors, search with % for white gray black neutral etc and replace
- dark and light mode
- improve css of map?

## Buildings page

- order by name/architect/date built.
- Filter by Architect.
- Shuffle button.
- Search bar.
- filter to see ones you've visited / unvisited
- back to top floating button
- Instead of get directions, should say "View on map" and link back to map page, with that feature clicked. This will need a duplicate feature card component.

## Game page

- build a game using the same data, to test user's on their knowledge of the buildings. E.g. Photo, what building is this, user inputs their answer.

## Sharing

- share in some of [these places](https://github.com/KingMenes/awesome-launch)
- share with hidden architecture
