# Todo Now

## Improve Styling

- Use SASS to style components and make it tighter, e.g. button etc.
  - Use [this guide](https://www.elian.codes/blog/21-04-13-writing-your-own-components-with-tailwind-sass/).
  - Look at where tailwind is repeated a lot, basically abstract css into components just like react is abstracted into components.
  - Use Take Back Water as example for SCSS code and what can do with it.
  - Use SASS to build design consistency, even things like default colours etc. use variables etc.
- Check mobile styling
  - Mobile map shouldnt overflow onto footer
  - No layout shift on mobile header.
- mobile menu should fold up when click on something.

## Add Landing Page

- Brutalist map needs to be usable from the start, with landing page (Should be able to just jump on website and use it)
- like on this:(https://pinballmap.com/) and on dailychallenges site.

# Later

## Other

- get directions, make into button
- edit readme so other people can use/edit. Write contributing.md maybe.
- visited count should just show local storage items visited, not other stuff in local storage. ie should be 3 not 5 now.
- Improve SEO so it shows up on google.

- More info links for the buildings - there are some really good websites out there about these buildings which I'd like to signpost to users of the map.

## Buildings page

- order by name/architect/date built.
- Filter by Architect.
- Shuffle button.
- Search bar.
- filter to see ones you've visited / unvisited
- back to top floating button
- Instead of get directions, should say "View on map".

## Game page

- I wanted to build a game using the same data, to test user's on their knowledge of the buildings. E.g. Photo, what building is this, user inputs their answer.
- Fix the game so it works - commented out in header atm.
- add more steps to game - atm just says correct or incorrect. Score counter etc.
