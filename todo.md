- Use SASS to rebuild components, e.g. button etc.

  - Maybe styled components too.

- Brutalist map needs to be usable from the start, with landing page (sShould be able to just jump on website and use it)
- Traditional information hierarchy, header in certain place, about subsection in certain place
- Brutalist map should have normal navigation header

- change header so it has a hamburger menu
- check mobile

  - no layout shift

- download all image links as webp images and use them in the map

- get directions button

- extract into components more

- edit readme so other people can use/edit. Write contributing md maybe.

- about page - text just on left column, image on right. Image of brutalist interior, like view from inside a Trellick flat.
