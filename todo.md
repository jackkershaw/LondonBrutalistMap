## Priority

- When click another marker, it should close the other one (use Redux([guide here](https://egghead.io/courses/fundamentals-of-redux-course-from-dan-abramov-bd5cc867)))

## Improve Styling

- fix for mobile - iphone se not looking great.
- apply default colours consistently.
  -Consistent colors, search with % for white gray black neutral etc and replace
- Use sass, see articles on why better than tailwind / other approach basically, use to demonstrate that can use sass/styled components and other forms of css
- dark and light mode

## Buildings page

- order by name/architect/date built.
- Filter by Architect.
- Shuffle button.
- Search bar.
- filter to see ones you've visited / unvisited
- back to top floating button
- Instead of get directions, should say "View on map" and link back to map page, with that feature clicked. This will need a duplicate feature card component.

## Game page

- I wanted to build a game using the same data, to test user's on their knowledge of the buildings. E.g. Photo, what building is this, user inputs their answer.
