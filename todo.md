- Keep extracting out into components, and use SASS to style them
  - Use SASS to rebuild components, e.g. button etc.

## Add Landing Page

- Brutalist map needs to be usable from the start, with landing page (Should be able to just jump on website and use it)

## Header

- no layout shift on mobile

## About Page

- Text just on left column, image on right. Image of brutalist interior, like view from inside a Trellick flat.

## Other

- get directions, make into button

- edit readme so other people can use/edit. Write contributing.md maybe.

## Things I'd like to implement later / Useful contributions:

- see maps folder -https://www.pinballmap.com/ for inspo of tech stack and how the app runs
- see nearby wiki, could maybe use wiki pages. Look at how they made it a mobile app running in chrome
- Maybe data like: https://www.crimesofsolidarity.org/data using Airtable, including way for users to add their own data.
- Improve SEO.
- Dynamic Routes so a page is generated for each building.
- More info links for the buildings - there are some really good websites out there about these buildings which I'd like to signpost to users of the map.
- Make suggestions button, link to contact page...
- Index page
  - order by name/architect/date built.
  - Filter by Architect.
  - Shuffle button.
  - Search bar.
- Game page
  - I wanted to build a game using the same data, to test user's on their knowledge of the buildings. E.g. Photo, what building is this, user inputs their answer.
  - Fix the game so it works - commented out in header atm.
  - add more steps to game - atm just says correct or incorrect. Score counter etc. Add places already got right to local storage.
- Index page

  - Instead of get directions link, have view on map which takes to map page.
  - filter to see ones you've visited / unvisited OR show just visited and then click show more option.
  - back to top floating button

- Contact page
  - Reinstate this page and get form working properly with Netlify or another form service
