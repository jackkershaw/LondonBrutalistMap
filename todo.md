# Now

- Use SASS to style components, e.g. button etc. Look at where tailwind is repeated a lot. Use [this guide](https://www.elian.codes/blog/21-04-13-writing-your-own-components-with-tailwind-sass/)

## Add Landing Page

- Brutalist map needs to be usable from the start, with landing page (Should be able to just jump on website and use it)
- like on this:(https://pinballmap.com/) and on dailychallenges site.

## Header

- no layout shift on mobile

# Later

## Other

- get directions, make into button
- edit readme so other people can use/edit. Write contributing.md maybe.
- visited count should just show local storage items visited, not other stuff in local storage. ie should be 3 not 5 now.
- Improve SEO.
- More info links for the buildings - there are some really good websites out there about these buildings which I'd like to signpost to users of the map.

## Buildings page

- order by name/architect/date built.
- Filter by Architect.
- Shuffle button.
- Search bar.
- filter to see ones you've visited / unvisited
- back to top floating button
- Instead of get directions, should say "View on map".

## Game page

- I wanted to build a game using the same data, to test user's on their knowledge of the buildings. E.g. Photo, what building is this, user inputs their answer.
- Fix the game so it works - commented out in header atm.
- add more steps to game - atm just says correct or incorrect. Score counter etc.
