## Priority

Redux - do this tutorial using sandbox to make sure understand it well. Tutorial [here](https://daveceddia.com/redux-tutorial/)

## Fix Mobile Styling

- work from iphone se upwards, use Responsively.
- Close header on click on mobile.
- post on reddit etc again when looking good on mobile.

look into using mapbox interactions and potentially move back to mapbox as it loads faster

## Buildings page

- order by name/architect/date built.
- Filter by Architect.
- Shuffle button.
- Search bar.
- filter to see ones you've visited / unvisited
- back to top floating button
- Instead of get directions, should say "View on map" and link back to map page, with that feature clicked. This will need a duplicate feature card component.

## Sharing

- share in some of [these places](https://github.com/KingMenes/awesome-launch)
- share with hidden architecture
