            <p className="py-4 text-xl">
              Brutalism is an architectural style that emerged in the 1950s. It
              1950s. It is characterized by its use of raw, unfinished concrete,
              concrete, bold geometric shapes, and an expressive design
              approach. The term "brutalism" originates from Le Corbusier's
              Corbusier's phrase in French: "b√©ton brut," which means "raw
              concrete."

              London has some of the best examples of Brutalism in the world.
              After World War II, a group of idealists began to rebuild the city
              in concrete. What remain are some of the most striking civic and
              housing projects ever built.
